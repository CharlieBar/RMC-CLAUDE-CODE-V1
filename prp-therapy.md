## What is PRP Therapy?

Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy is an advanced regenerative treatment that harnesses your body's natural healing capabilities. By concentrating platelets from your own blood, we create a powerful healing solution that can dramatically reduce pain and accelerate tissue repair.

PRP is particularly effective for workplace injuries where joints, tendons, or ligaments have been damaged. Many of our patients who sustained injuries on the job find PRP helps them avoid surgery and return to work faster.

## How PRP Works

Your platelets contain growth factors and healing proteins that trigger tissue regeneration. When we concentrate these platelets and inject them directly into injured areas, we deliver a powerful dose of your body's own healing factors exactly where they're needed most.

This natural approach means:
- No synthetic drugs or medications
- Lower risk of adverse reactions
- Your body recognizes and accepts the treatment
- Healing happens from within

## Conditions We Treat with PRP

PRP therapy at Rand Medical Center is especially effective for:

**Work-Related Injuries:**
- Repetitive strain injuries from lifting, typing, or machinery operation
- Joint injuries from falls or accidents
- Tendon damage from overuse
- Ligament sprains

**Chronic Pain Conditions:**
- Osteoarthritis of knees, shoulders, or hips
- Chronic tendonitis (tennis elbow, golfer's elbow)
- Rotator cuff injuries
- Plantar fasciitis
- Lower back pain

## The PRP Treatment Process

Your PRP therapy appointment typically takes about an hour. Here's what happens:

1. **Consultation & Evaluation** - We review your injury, medical history, and imaging results to determine if PRP is right for you.

2. **Blood Collection** - A small blood sample is drawn from your arm (similar to routine lab work).

3. **Centrifuge Processing** - Your blood is placed in a centrifuge that spins at high speed, separating and concentrating the platelets.

4. **Preparation** - The concentrated PRP is prepared in a sterile syringe.

5. **Injection** - Using ultrasound guidance for precision, we inject the PRP directly into your injured tissue.

6. **Post-Treatment Care** - You'll receive specific instructions for the first 24-48 hours to maximize healing.

## Recovery & Results

Most patients experience minimal downtime after PRP therapy. You can typically:
- Return to light activities the same day
- Resume normal activities within 2-3 days
- Begin noticing pain reduction within 2-4 weeks
- Experience continued improvement over 2-3 months

Some patients benefit from a series of 2-3 treatments spaced several weeks apart for optimal results.

## PRP for Workers' Compensation Cases

If you were injured at work, PRP therapy is covered by workers' compensation insurance. We handle all the paperwork and authorization requirements, making the process simple for you.

Benefits for injured workers:
- Faster return to work
- Avoid time off for surgery
- Reduce dependence on pain medications
- Covered by workers' comp insurance
- We work directly with your employer and insurance

## Is PRP Right for You?

PRP therapy may be an excellent option if you:
- Have chronic pain that hasn't responded to conservative treatment
- Want to avoid surgery or delay surgical intervention
- Experienced a work-related injury
