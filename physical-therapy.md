## Your Physical Therapy Journey

### Week 1-2: Pain Management & Protection
Initial treatment focuses on reducing pain and inflammation while protecting injured tissues. We use gentle techniques and modalities to provide relief while beginning safe movement.

### Week 3-4: Restore Mobility
As pain decreases, we progressively increase range of motion exercises and begin strengthening weak areas. Manual therapy helps restore normal joint movement.

### Week 5-8: Build Strength
Exercise intensity increases to rebuild strength and endurance. We incorporate functional movements that mimic your work activities.

### Week 9-12: Return to Work Preparation
Final phase focuses on work-specific conditioning, preventing re-injury, and ensuring you can safely perform all job duties.
