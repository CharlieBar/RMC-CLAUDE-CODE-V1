# Human Writing Style Guide

Create content that sounds like it was written by a caring medical professional, not generated by AI. This guide ensures all Rand Medical Center content feels authentic, warm, and trustworthy.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Write Like You Talk (But Better)
- Use conversational language that's professional yet approachable
- Read your content aloud—if it sounds stiff, rewrite it
- Vary sentence length naturally (short punchy sentences mixed with longer explanatory ones)
- Use contractions: "you'll" not "you will", "we're" not "we are"

### 2. Lead with Empathy
- Acknowledge the reader's pain, frustration, or concern first
- Show you understand their situation before offering solutions
- Use "you" language to speak directly to the reader
- Avoid clinical detachment—these are real people with real problems

### 3. Be Specific, Not Generic
- Replace vague claims with concrete details
- Use real numbers, timeframes, and outcomes
- Include specific examples patients can relate to
- Avoid empty phrases like "state-of-the-art" or "world-class"

## Sentence Structure

### Vary Your Openings
Don't start every sentence or paragraph the same way.

**BAD (Repetitive):**
```
Back pain affects millions of Americans. Back pain can make it difficult to work.
Back pain often disrupts sleep. Back pain treatment is available at Rand Medical Center.
```

**GOOD (Varied):**
```
Back pain affects millions of Americans each year. It can make sitting at your desk
unbearable and keep you up at night. If you're tired of canceling plans because of
your back, we can help.
```

### Mix Sentence Lengths
- Short sentences create impact
- Longer sentences provide explanation and flow, connecting ideas naturally
- One-word sentences? Occasionally.
- Never more than three long sentences in a row

### Active Voice (Usually)
**Passive:** "Treatment will be provided by our specialists."
**Active:** "Our specialists will treat you."

**Passive:** "Pain relief can be achieved through..."
**Active:** "You can find relief through..."

## Tone Guidelines

### Medical Content Tone
- **Confident but not arrogant**: "We've successfully treated thousands of patients" not "We're the best in the region"
- **Reassuring but honest**: Acknowledge challenges while offering hope
- **Educational but accessible**: Explain medical terms simply
- **Urgent but not scary**: Encourage action without fear-mongering

### Empathy Patterns

**Opening with empathy:**
```
"If you're dealing with sciatica, you know how exhausting it is to be in constant
pain. Simple things—sitting at dinner, playing with your kids, getting a full
night's sleep—become challenges. You've probably tried everything: stretches,
ice packs, over-the-counter painkillers. And you're wondering if anything will
actually work."
```

**Transitioning to hope:**
```
"Here's the good news: sciatica is treatable. Most patients see significant
improvement within weeks, not months. And you don't have to figure this out alone."
```

---

## Paragraph Structure

### The "So What?" Test
Every paragraph should answer: "Why does this matter to the reader?"

**Before:**
```
Rand Medical Center has been serving Arlington Heights since 2008. Our facility
features modern equipment and our staff includes board-certified physicians.
```

**After:**
```
For over 15 years, Arlington Heights families have trusted us with their care.
That means when you walk in, you're seen by doctors who know this community—and
who've helped thousands of patients just like you get back to their lives.
```

### Ideal Paragraph Length
- 2-4 sentences for web content
- One main idea per paragraph
- Use single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis (sparingly)

---

## Formatting for Readability

### Use Bullet Points When:
- Listing 3+ items
- Presenting symptoms, features, or benefits
- Creating scannable content

### Use Numbers When:
- Order matters (steps in a process)
- Showing progression or priority
- Creating "listicle" content

### Use Bold for:
- Key terms readers are searching for
- Important warnings or notes
- Scannable headers within long text

---

## Medical Writing Specifics

### Explaining Medical Terms
Don't assume knowledge, but don't be condescending.

**Too technical:**
"Lumbar radiculopathy results from nerve root compression in the L4-L5 or L5-S1 segments."

**Too simple:**
"Your back hurts because of a pinched nerve thing."

**Just right:**
"Sciatica happens when something presses on your sciatic nerve—usually a herniated disc or bone spur in your lower back. This pressure causes the shooting pain down your leg."

### Balancing Accuracy and Accessibility
- Use the medical term, then explain it
- Include both common and clinical names
- Provide context for statistics

**Example:**
"About 40% of people experience sciatica at some point—that's nearly half the population dealing with this shooting leg pain."

---

## Calls to Action

### Make CTAs Human
**Generic:** "Schedule an appointment today."
**Better:** "Ready to feel better? Let's get you scheduled."

**Generic:** "Contact us for more information."
**Better:** "Have questions? We're happy to answer them—call us or send a message."

### Reduce Friction in Language
- "Call us" not "Contact our office"
- "Get started" not "Initiate your treatment journey"
- "Book online" not "Utilize our digital scheduling platform"

## Voice Consistency Checklist

Before publishing, ask:

- [ ] Does this sound like a real person wrote it?
- [ ] Would I say this out loud to a patient?
- [ ] Did I cut unnecessary filler words?
- [ ] Are sentences varied in length and structure?
- [ ] Does the opening hook the reader emotionally?
- [ ] Is every paragraph answering "so what?"
- [ ] Are medical terms explained clearly?
- [ ] Does the CTA sound inviting, not demanding?

## Examples: Before & After

### Service Description

**AI-Sounding:**
```
At Rand Medical Center, we leverage our comprehensive pain management services to
deliver optimal outcomes for patients suffering from chronic pain conditions. Our
holistic approach utilizes cutting-edge interventional techniques to facilitate
lasting relief and improved quality of life.
```

**Human:**
```
Chronic pain changes everything—how you sleep, how you work, how you show up for
your family. Our pain management team has spent years helping patients find relief
when nothing else has worked. We'll figure out exactly what's causing your pain
and build a treatment plan that actually fits your life.
```

### Condition Overview

**AI-Sounding:**
```
Sciatica is a prevalent condition affecting the sciatic nerve, which is the longest
nerve in the human body. Patients experiencing sciatica may present with symptoms
including radiating pain, numbness, and tingling sensations in the lower extremities.
```

**Human:**
```
That sharp pain shooting from your lower back down your leg? That's sciatica—and
if you have it, you know how miserable it can be. The sciatic nerve runs from your
back all the way down each leg, and when something presses on it, you feel it with
every step, every time you sit down, sometimes even when you're trying to sleep.
```

## Quick Reference: Human Writing Formula

1. **Open with the reader's reality** (what they're experiencing)
2. **Acknowledge their frustration** (show you understand)
3. **Offer hope with specifics** (not vague promises)
4. **Explain clearly** (no jargon, no fluff)
5. **Guide to action** (make next step easy)

Remember: Real humans are reading this while they're in pain, worried, or searching for answers. Write for them.
